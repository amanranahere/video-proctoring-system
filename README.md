# Video Proctoring System

A computer vision-based proctoring module that demonstrated how remote candidates can be monitored during online exams or interviews.
This project is not a full-fleged exam platform, instead it serves as a proof-of-concept to show how real-time monitoring and suspicious activity detection can be achieved using modern ML tools.

## âš¡ Features

- Live video streaming of the candidate.
- Activity detection: multiple faces, mobile/laptop detection, etc.
- Real-time warnings with timestamps.
- Summary proctoring report generation.

<br>

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project demonstrated a method of proctoring that could be integrated into:
- Online examination portols
- Remote interview platforms
- E-learning and certification systems
